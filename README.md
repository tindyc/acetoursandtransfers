## Getting Started

### 1) Environment File (`.env`)
This project requires an `.env` file in the root directory for email functionality (PHPMailer SMTP) to work.

**Example `.env` file:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_USER=booking@acetoursandtransfers.co.uk
SMTP_PASS=PASSWORD_HERE
FROM_EMAIL=booking@acetoursandtransfers.co.uk
FROM_NAME="Ace Tours & Transfers"
OWNER_TO=booking@acetoursandtransfers.co.uk
```

### 2) Importance of the vendor/ Folder
The vendor/ folder is critical. It contains Composer dependencies, including PHPMailer, used to send emails from the booking form.

If vendor/ is missing:

The contact form will fail to send emails.

PHP will throw ‚Äúclass not found‚Äù errors.

Tip: Never delete vendor/ when deploying. If it‚Äôs missing, run:
```
composer install
```
